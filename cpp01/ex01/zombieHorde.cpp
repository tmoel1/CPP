#include "Zombie.hpp"

Zombie* zombieHorde( int N, std::string name ) // declare where???
// subject spsecifies function, not method or membern so i guess it's outside of the class
// and also gives the prototype without a "Zombie::" scope qualifier which indicates it's outside the class - but outside of the hpp??

// can choose to name then all identically or add some sort of index??
