# CPP - a work-in-progress

_A leap into the modern (1998) world of object oriented programming_...

<br>

## So, what is this project(s) all about?

This series of C++ exercises is sort of like a piscine/bootcamp style introduction to C++ 98 and the concept of objects. The... objective... here is to get familiar with all the 'new' concepts that weren't present in base C, resulting in an... objectively... fairly solid understanding of the low-level functionality of the the two types of languages.

<br>

## Objectifying C:

_The progression through the various modules is laid out below_:

<br>

**Module 00:** C++ syntax, compilation and structuring header/source files

**Module 01:** Canonical class form – constructors, destructors, copy/move semantics

**Module 02:** Operator overloading and basic stream I/O

**Module 03:** Inheritance, polymorphism and abstract base classes

**Module 04:** Exception safety and custom error types

**Module 05:** Function templates and basic generic programming

**Module 06:** Advanced templates (variadic, SFINAE) and constexpr

**Module 07:** The STL – containers, iterators and algorithms

**Module 08:** Dynamic resource management with smart pointers

**Module 09:** Concurrency – threads, mutexes and condition variables
